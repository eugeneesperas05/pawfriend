              <p class="lead">
                PawFriend Adoption Pet was founded in March 2023 by WD55 class from KodeGo especially Mr. E. Esperas an animal lover who were concerned about the high number of dogs and cats in shelters who were in need of forever homes. With a mission to improve animal welfare and promote responsible pet ownership, the founders of PawFriend Adoption Pet worked tirelessly to establish the organization and develop programs and services to support its mission.

              <h4 class="mb-4">How PawFriend Started?</h4>
                <p class="lead">
                  there was a student who was passionate about animals. He often spent his 
                  free time volunteering at local animal shelters, playing with cats and dogs, and learning about their 
                  different personalities and needs.
                  One day, his teacher assigned them a mini-project: to create a website that promotes their interest and hobbies. 
                  This student is excited about the idea and immediately started brainstorming. He wanted his website 
                  to be different from others, and he wanted it to truly make a difference in the lives of animals.
                  He spent hours researching and gathering information, and after weeks of hard work, he finally 
                  launched his website: Pawfriend. The website featured heartwarming stories of cats and dogs who 
                  were once homeless but found their forever homes through adoption. It also provided helpful tips for 
                  potential pet owners, such as how to choose the right pet for their lifestyle and how to take care of 
                  their new furry friend.
                  At first, the website received only a few visitors since the website is using a personal link, because it's not up 
                  to the internet at the moment, but the student didn't give up. He continued 
                  to spread the word about Pawfriend, sharing it on social media, and even reaching out to his local barangay
                  about his project. Slowly but surely, more people started visiting the website and sharing 
                  its message.
                  The student were ecstatic when he received his first success story: a family who had adopted a dog 
                  from PawFriend shelter after reading about Pawfriend. The family had been hesitant about adopting a pet, 
                  but after reading about the joy and love that a furry companion could bring, they decided to 
                  take the leap.
                  From that moment on, Pawfriend will continue to grow and inspire others to adopt pets in need. 
                  The student felt proud of his project, knowing that he will make a difference in the lives 
                  of countless animals and families.
                  <b>(I want to use this next paragraph for the future.)</b>
                  (  Years later, the student would look back on his mini-project with fondness, knowing that it 
                  had sparked a lifelong passion for animal welfare and advocacy. Pawfriend had not only helped 
                  animals find their forever homes, but it had also helped the student find one of his purpose in life. )

        <p class="card-text" id="p-text2">
          "I have fond memories of my childhood, when my father compassionately cared for numerous stray cats and dogs, even nursing those in dire condition back to health. This nurturing behavior left a lasting impression on me. Subsequently, these feral animals began awaiting our presence every morning. It's clear that my love for animals is an inheritance from my father. Skipping ahead to 2011, I encountered Puma, a distressed cat, in a sorry state on the streets. Without a moment's hesitation, I brought her into our home, provided her with necessary medical attention, and thankfully, she made a full recovery. Puma's eyes are truly distinctive – one is a striking blue, while the other boasts a warm yellowish-brown hue. In 2016, when Puma turned five, she gave birth to three endearing kittens. Remarkably, one of them inherited her captivating heterochromatic eyes, quickly becoming the favorite within our family. This kitten, whom I affectionately named Oreo, has remained by my side ever since. Oreo has now reached the age of six and is currently expecting her own litter. While some may consider cats with such unique eyes to be valuable, I could never put a price on Oreo. The immense happiness and joy she has brought to my family make her an invaluable part of our lives – my eternal fur baby."
